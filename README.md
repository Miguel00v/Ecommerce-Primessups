Online Store - PrimeSupps Briefing

Introduction
This final project consists of creating an online store focused on supplementation products. The choice of this theme reflects my personal appreciation for health and vitality. During the planning phase, I used the Design Thinking methodology to ensure a user-centered and innovative approach. The development was done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with the help of frameworks and libraries to optimize the process and ensure a high-quality user experience.

Empathy / Target Audience
The online store is aimed at an audience interested in health and wellness, with a special focus on supplementation. To define the persona, research was conducted on several supplementation websites (such as Prozis, Zumub, and MyProtein), comparing navigation, design, functionalities, and user perceptions.

Needs and Desires: Seeks high-quality products. Wants detailed and reliable information about products. Prefers a fast, easy, and intuitive shopping experience with a modern design.

Problem Definition / Website Objective
Based on the research from the empathy phase, the main objective of the website is to sell dietary supplements quickly and efficiently, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience.

Sitemap
The sitemap was developed using brainstorming and treehouse techniques to organize and structure the pages and their functionalities. The sitemap is available in the PDF file in the briefing folder, named mapaSite.pdf.

Content
Visual Identity
The name "PrimeSupps" was chosen to reflect exclusivity and quality in the supplement niche. The logo was designed with vibrant colors and modern typography, conveying vitality, health, and optimism. The full visual identity is available in the identidadeVisual folder.

Texts and Images
All legal texts, such as privacy policies and terms and conditions, have been written. Images for banners, products, and other visual elements are organized in the content folder.

Domain and Hosting
I purchased the domain primesupps.pt and conducted a simulated purchase of hosting services on the amen.pt platform. Details of the simulation can be found in the content folder.

Gmail Account
A Gmail account was created to manage brand communications with the following details:

Email: primesupps.pt@gmail.com
Password: TrabalhoFinal123

Design / Ideation
Wireframes
The wireframes were developed in Figma and can be found in the design folder, named wireframes.

Style Guide
The Style Guide was created after the wireframes, defining colors, typography, spacing, and other visual elements. It is available in the styleGuide folder.

Database
An Entity-Relationship Diagram was created for the database using Figma. The sketch is available in the design folder under esbocoBaseDados.

Prototyping / Development

Database
The database was implemented using phpMyAdmin and SQL scripts, following these steps:

Analysis of the Sketch: Understanding the structure and requirements.
Data Model: Defining entities such as users, products, and transactions, and their attributes.
Normalization and Implementation: Normalization ensured consistency and avoided redundancy.
Back-end
The back-end development was done in PHP to connect pages to the database and implement functionalities such as:

Checkout with Stripe API: Secure payments with the option to save payment methods.
Shopping Cart: Dynamic creation and storage of items in the database.
Session System: User management, authentication, and access control with email verification.
Administration: Administrator area with control over users, products, orders, and legal documents.
Front-end
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to develop a responsive and user-friendly interface. I used Flexbox and Grid for layouts and Font Awesome for icons.

Navigation between pages, forms, and interface elements was verified.

Usability Testing
The simplicity and clarity of the user interface were evaluated.

Compatibility Testing
Tests were carried out on the most common browsers to ensure consistency.
